    <p>The master of science in athletic training prepares students for a career as a certified athletic trainer.
      Athletic trainers (ATs) are health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and
      participation of patients and clients. The services provided by ATs comprise prevention, diagnosis and
      intervention of emergency, acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment, functional limitations and
      disabilities. Athletic training is recognized by the American Medical Association as a healthcare profession.
      The
      master of science in athletic training (MS.AT) will begin in summer 2015 and will be a full-time, cohort-model
      program.&nbsp;

    <!-- Two sample iframe embeds. One YouTube, the other the civic engagment widget.
    A JS function will wrap these in div.video tags. YouTube embeds require special
    styling to deal with margin/padding issues. Others probably don't. -->

    <p><b>As a cohort-model program, admission into the MS.AT program is highly competitive and limited.</b></p>
    <p>
      This full-time, intensive program is a rich combination of didactic, hands-on clinical laboratories, and clinical fieldwork providing carefully guided clinical experiences every semester. Clinical fieldwork placements include a variety of colleges, universities, high schools and physician offices.
