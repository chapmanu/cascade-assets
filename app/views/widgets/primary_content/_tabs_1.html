            width="98">Dr. Mark Maier</a> (Ph.D in Social Organization and Social Change- Sociology, Cornell University) is the Program
        Director for the Leadership Studies Minor.&nbsp; He served as founding chair of Chapman's Organizational Leadership
        Programs from 1994-2002, and guided the program's ascension to national prominence when it garnered
        <em>The Outstanding Leadership Program Award</em> from the Association of Leadership Educators, a national consortium
        of leadership development experts from academia as well as the public and private sector.&nbsp; He came to Chapman
        in 1994 to inaugurate its undergraduate and graduate programs in leadership, on the strength of his role creating
        one of the first academic programs devoted to leadership in the nation, the
        <em>Leadership and Organization Studies Program</em> at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Binghamton (1986-1994).</p>
